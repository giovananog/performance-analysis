Exercises (Chapter 1)

1. The following data yield the arrival times and service times that each customer will require, for the first 13 customers at a single server system. Upon
arrival, a customer either enters service if the server is free or joins the waiting
line. When the server completes work on a customer, the next one in line (i.e.,
the one who has been waiting the longest) enters service.

Arrival Times: 12 31 63 95 99 154 198 221 304 346 411 455 537
Service Times: 40 32 55 48 18 50 47 18 28 54 40 72 12


(a) Determine the departure times of these 13 customers.
(b) Repeat (a) when there are two servers and a customer can be served by
either one.
(c) Repeat (a) under the new assumption that when the server completes
a service, the next customer to enter service is the one who has been
waiting the least time.
